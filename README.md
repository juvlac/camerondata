# camerondata

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of camerondata is to provide graduate students and applied
researchers with a quick and easy access to data sets that let them
replicate the empirical examples found in Cameron and Trivediâ€™s
Microeconometrics Methods and Applications.

## How to install

You can install the development version of camerondata from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("juvlac/camerondata")
```

## Example

``` r
# Load camerondata package
library(camerondata)


# Subsample: only two modes of fishing
subsample <- fishing %>% 
  filter(mode == 2 | mode == 4) %>% 
  select(mode, dcharter, pcharter, ppier)
```

``` r

# Overall Data Summary
subsample %>% 
  summarize(meanPriceCharter = mean(pcharter),
            meanPricePier = mean(ppier),
            n = n()) 
#> # A tibble: 1 x 3
#>   meanPriceCharter meanPricePier     n
#>              <dbl>         <dbl> <int>
#> 1             84.9          95.2   630
```

``` r

# Data Summary by charter boat (y=1) and pier (y=0)
subsample %>% 
  group_by(dcharter) %>% 
  summarize(MeanPriceCharter = mean(pcharter),
            MeanPricePier = mean(ppier),
            n = n())
#> # A tibble: 2 x 4
#>   dcharter MeanPriceCharter MeanPricePier     n
#>      <int>            <dbl>         <dbl> <int>
#> 1        0            110.           30.6   178
#> 2        1             75.1         121.    452
```

``` r
# Relative frequency in subsample
table(subsample$dcharter)/length(subsample$dcharter)
#> 
#>         0         1 
#> 0.2825397 0.7174603
